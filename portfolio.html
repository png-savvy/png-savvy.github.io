                <h5>New User Automation</h5>
                <p>This project involves the use of API's remote desktop connections and azure functions. 
                  In short, whenever a new user is accepted to the university that I work at it will trigger 
                  my azure functions to update the new users account and send the new user an email with his
                  log in credentials.
